summary     : Command-line MPRIS-compatible Media Player Controller
description : |
    Playerctl is a command-line utility and library for controlling media players
    that implement the MPRIS D-Bus Interface Specification. Playerctl makes it easy
    to bind player actions, such as play and pause, to media keys. You can also get
    metadata about the playing track such as the artist and title for integration
    into statusline generators or other command-line tools.

    For more advanced users, Playerctl provides an introspectable library available
    in your favorite scripting language that allows more detailed control like the
    ability to subscribe to media player events or get metadata such as artist and
    title for the playing track.

    Examples of players implementing the MPRIS D-Bus Interface Specification include
    vlc, mpv, RhythmBox, web browsers, cmus, mpd, spotify and others.
