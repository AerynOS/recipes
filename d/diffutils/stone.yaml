summary     : GNU utilities to compute and compare difference between files
description : |
    GNU Diffutils is a package of several programs related to finding differences between files.
    
    Computer users often find occasion to ask how two files differ. Perhaps one file is a newer version of the other file. Or maybe the two files started out as identical copies but were changed by different people.
