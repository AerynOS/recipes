## recipes

This repository contains all of the recipes required to build Serpent OS
from source.

## Git summary requirements

To keep git summaries readable, serpent-os requires the following git summary format

- `name: Add at v<version>`
- `name: Update to v<version>`
- `name: Fix <...>`
- `name: [NFC] <description of no functional change>`

The use of the `Initial inclusion` verbiage is _strongly discouraged_.

## Current focus

Packaging focus should be on bringing up the GNOME Desktop + associated stack

Other areas of focus:

 - Stateless enabling (+ hermetic usr)
 - Kernel enabling
 - Metrics-based performance improvements
 - Package updates and bug fixes

The aim for our desktop right now is to ship the following:

 - GNOME Shell
 - Flatpak w/ preconfigured flathub
 - GNOME Software (pending moss integration)
 - GNOME Console or Terminal
 - Nautilus
 - GNOME Control Center
 - Firefox
 - Thunderbird
