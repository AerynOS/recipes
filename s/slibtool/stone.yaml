summary     : a surrogate libtool implementation, written in C
description : |
    `slibtool` is an independent reimplementation of the widely used libtool,
    written in C. `slibtool` is designed to be a clean, fast, easy-to-use
    libtool drop-in replacement, and is accordingly aimed at package authors,
    distro developers, and system integrators. `slibtool` maintains compatibility
    with libtool in nearly every aspect of the tool's functionality as well as
    semantics, leaving out (or turning into a no-op) only a small number of
    features that are no longer needed on modern systems.
    
    Being a compiled binary, and although not primarily written for the sake of
    performance, building a package with `slibtool` is often faster than with its
    script-based counterpart. The resulting performance gain would normally vary
    between packages, and is most noticeable in builds that invoke libtool a large
    number of times, and which are characterized by the short compilation duration
    of individual translation units.
