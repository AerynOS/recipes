description : |
    xwayland-run contains a set of small utilities revolving around running Xwayland and various Wayland compositor headless. Initially, xwayland-run was intended as a replacement for the xvfb-run utility
    that ships with some distributions. However, while implementing the features for spawning various Wayland compositors headless and Xwayland rootful, it became clear that it might be useful to
    actually split that into different (yet related) smaller utilities which could be used separately for different purposes. So now, xwayland-run actually contains 3 different tools, namely:

    xwayland-run, to spawn an X11 client within its own dedicated Xwayland rootful instance,
    wlheadless-run to run a Wayland client on a set of supported Wayland headless compositors,
    xwfb-run, a combination of the two other tools above to be used as a direct replacement for xvfb-run specifically.
